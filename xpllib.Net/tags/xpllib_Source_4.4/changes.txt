Version 4.4, 18th of May 2008

Modifications:
--------------

- Configuration items must be defined  before they can be used, but  they remain
available throughout the lifetime of the  Listener object.  (There used to be  a
problem  with   empty  multi-valued   configuration  items   after  receiving  a
configuration from xPLHAL.)
- The  XplConfigDone event  is raised  when either  the configuration was loaded
from a local XML  file or when it  was received from an  xpl manager application
like xPLHAL.  Examine the event parameter if it matters what the source was.
- XplMsg:  completely rewritten.   It enforces  correct xpl  messages.  The  old
interface is kept for compatibility reasons  but please do not use the  obsolete
properties in new code.

See the readme file for an example on how to use the xPLListener and XpMsg objects.
The usage differs slightly from previous versions.

Version 4.1, 27th September 2005

New Features
------------

- The xPL listener will now respond to hbeat.request messages with a heartbeat message (either config.app or hbeat.app as appropriate).  The response will be between 1 and 3 seconds after the request was received.
- The version number of the calling application is now included in all heartbeat messages.

Version 4.0, 19th September 2005

New Features:
------------

- The xPL Listener will now send out hbeat/config messages at a 3 second interval to probe for a hub.
- If a hub is not detected within 120 seconds, this interval changes to 30 seconds.
- A new property of the xPLListener object called JoinedXplNetwork can be used by applications
  to determine whether a hub has been detected.
- A new event called xPLJoinedXplNetwork is raised whenever a hub is detected.

Modifications:
--------------

- A built-in hub is no longer included.
- The SuppressHub parameter has been removed from the constructor of the xPLListener object.

Fixes:
-----

- Heartbeat messages were being sent out at interval+1 minutes.

Version 3.1, 3rd January 2005

New Features
------------

- Added a property to the filters object called AlwaysPassMessages - set to false by default.
If set to true, the listener object will always raise the XplMessageReceived event
when an xPL message is received, even if the listener is waiting to be configured.
This behaviour can be useful for applications such as xPLHal that need to act
as configuration managers.

Version 3.0, 2nd January 2004

New Features
------------

** No more need for an xPL Hub **

** Configurable Filters **

Use xPLHal to set the filters of the xPL applications.


** Multi-valued Properties **

You have filters[16] and groups[16], now you can have your own myproperty[x].


** Security "ListenOn/ListenTo" **

ListenOn:  Configure the  xPL applications  to listen  on a  specific IP.   This
allows computers  with multiple  IP addresses  (multiple network  cards, virtual
networks, ...) to run xPL without duplicating messages.

ListenTo: Configure the xPL applications to accept only traffic from a  specific
(list of) address(es).

By default both options are set to "ANY_LOCAL".  This starts the xPL application
listening on  any local  IP address  and makes  it accept  only traffic from the
local pc.  This is a bit  more stringent than previous xPLLib versions  as these
accept any incoming traffic.

The hub automatically uses the same security settings.

ListenOn and ListenTo are configurable via registry settings in
[HKLM]/Software/xPL/ListenOnAddress
[HKLM]/Software/xPL/ListenToAddresses


Possible values are:
ListenOnAddress: "ANY_LOCAL" or a specific IP address.
ListenToAddresses: "ANY", "ANY_LOCAL"  or a list of specific comma-separated IP
addresses.

These registry settings are configurable by the xPL Network Settings Utility, available from:
http://www.xpl.myby.co.uk/downloads/utils/xplsettings.zip

Fixes
-----

* Does not keep more UDP ports open than necessary.
* Better event logging in case of failure.
* Fixed: HBEAT.END was not always sent.
* Fixed: cleanup of expired hubclients.
