=======================================================================
   HOW IT WORKS
=======================================================================
Information is gathered from the local systems registry and the xPL 
network, regarding installed and running devices. This information is 
then compared to information collected from the vendor-plugin-files 
(downloading those plugins will automatically start when the 
application is started)
The comparison is displayed in two tabs, showing the installed and 
available devices. The icons in the list identify current status (see 
below).

REMARKS:
1) The list created from the download plugins is NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE 
   LIST, as developers who wish not to maintain a plugin file will 
   not be listed.
2) Until the update is finished the old information will be shown, 
   and no new updates will be listed, so please be patient and 
   wait for the update to complete.

=======================================================================
   INSTALLED APPLICATIONS
=======================================================================
The 'Installed' tab shows all applications that have been seen (using 
the xPL protocols automatic-discovery methods) on the xPL network or 
are locally installed. The network applications are listed by their 
full xPL address, the local applications are listed as '[vendorid]-
[deviceid].(local installation)'.
The local-applications-part is used primarily for software that is xPL 
related, but does not expose itself as an xPL device (and hence cannot 
be detected on the xPL network). Examples are; hubs, diagnostic tools, 
etc.
Double clicking a device will show the available details.

Icons shown in the list:
EXCLAMATION     : Running versions are different from the vendor 
                  published version, indicating that there has been an
                  update
CHECK MARK      : Running versions are identical to the vendor 
                  published version, indicating no update has been 
                  issued
QUESTION MARK   : the device hasn't been found in the plugin list, so 
                  there is no vendor provided data to check against


=======================================================================
   AVAILABLE APPLICATIONS
=======================================================================
The applications listed here are collected using the 'plugin' system 
of the xPL Project (see http://xplproject.org.uk). Each developer 
('Vendor') maintains a plugin xml file that lists all devices by this 
vendor and many extra details about them. The xPL project maintains an 
overall plugin list, with urls to all vendor plugins.
By downloading the plugins a list is harvested of available xPL 
applications.
Double clicking a device will show the available details.

Icons shown in the list:
EXCLAMATION     : current versions are different from previous 
                  version, indicating that there has been an update
CHECK MARK      : versions are identical to previous versions, 
                  indicating no update has been issued
PLUS SIGN       : the device hasn't been seen before in the plugin 
                  list, so this is a newly published device

=======================================================================
   BUTTONS
=======================================================================
DETAILS         : shows the details of the highlighted device, 
                  including informational and download links (similar 
                  to double clicking a device in the list)
SCAN            : sends an xPL heartbeat request over the xPL network, 
                  to search for xPL devices
CLEAR STATUS    : until this button is pressed, the status info on the 
                  "available applications" is maintained (old updates 
                  remain marked as updates). Clearing the status means
                  that a new comparison baseline will be set and only
                  new updates from this point forward will be marked
                  as such.


=======================================================================
   ADDING YOUR APPLICATIONS (for developers)
=======================================================================
To maximize the benefits for the user (and to advertise your 
applications), follow the following guidelines;
 * make sure that the heartbeat messages of your device contains a key 
   named "version" (eg. "version=2.1")
 * if your software is non-device software, then make sure that 
   installing your application creates a registry key 
   "HKLM\Software\xPL\[vendorid]\[deviceid]" and a string value
   "Version" within that key. Because the software is non-device, 
   you'll have to come up with a 'virtual' unique device ID.
 * have your plugin xml file up-to-date with correct version 
   information, descriptions, etc.
 * Any other item that is neither a device nor an installable piece of 
   software, can be added to the 'Available' tab by using a 'virtual' 
   unique device ID and adding that ID to your plugin file. Examples 
   are code libraries, graphics, documentation, etc.
