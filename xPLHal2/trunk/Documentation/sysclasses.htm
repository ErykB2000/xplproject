    <h2>
        System Language Extensions</h2>
    <p>
        There are basically two objects specific to xPLHal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>$Sys</code> Class</p>
    The sys class provides extensions to PowerShell which allow the core elements of 
    the xPLHal server to be manipulated. All of the system classes are referenced by 
    the object name &quot;$Sys&quot;. Because PowerShell is case insensitive, $sys is also 
    valid.<br />
    <p>
        <code>$Msg</code> Class</p>
    <p>
        This class gives access to the xPL message the script reacted on, if there was one. Otherwise, the 
        object contains a <code>null</code> value. This will be the case with manual 
        script invocation.</p>
