        Introduction to Scripting in xPLHal</h2>
    <p>
        xPLHal has extensive scripting functionality. Basically it is possible to do 
        anything you can do with the xPLHal Manager, plus a lot more. This section is 
        intended to give an overview of those possibilities.</p>
    <p>
        Starting from xPLHal v2.0, the existing VBScript scripting functionality has 
        been completely replaced by two other, more modern languages: Microsoft 
        Powershell and Python. The reason is simply because Microsoft made it extremely 
        difficult to keep using &quot;old&quot; technology. For the moment only Powershell is 
        fully implemented.</p>

    <h3>Modifying and Reloading Scripts</h3>
    <a>It is important to realise that any changes made to scripts will not take 
    effect until either the xPLHal service is restarted, or the Reload Scripts 
    option is selected from the Scripts context menu in the xPLHal Manager.<br />
    This allows you to modify a number of scripts, and have the changes take effect 
    only when you have finished modifying all your scripts.</a>
    <h3>Language Extensions</h3>
    <a>In addition to the standard functions of both languages, scripts that are 
    executed by the xPLHal Scripting Engine have access to a number of extra 
    classes, designed to assist you in getting the most out of your xPLHal Home 
    Automation System.</a>

    The following topics describe the various language extension classes in more 
    detail.<br />
