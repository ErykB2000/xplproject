WELCOME

Thanks for checking out YAC.  YAC is a Caller ID system that uses
the modem in your Windows-based computer to monitor incoming phone
calls.  When a phone call is received, YAC displays the Caller ID
info on the computer screen.  YAC also contacts any "YAC Listeners"
(such as your TiVo) on the network and sends them Caller ID
information as well.  The TiVo Listener (this program) receives
that information and displays Caller ID on your TV screen.

YAC can also be used to send short text messages from your YAC
server to listeners on your network.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

A couple of acknowledgements are in order.  YAC was inspired by
the "elseed" TiVo Caller ID program.  Unfortunately, my TiVo's
modem was not consistently picking up Caller ID information, so I
was out of luck.  However, the YAC TiVo Listener is based on
"elseed", especially the very robust code to handle the hardware
display.  No one has done it better, and the YAC TiVo Listener
display code is taken directly from "elseed" (which based its
display code, in turn, on "tivobi").


GETTING STARTED

The YAC source code is licensed and distributed under the GNU General
Public License.  Be sure to read the LICENSE file before proceeding.

You'll need the TiVo cross-compiler installed on your linux dev box to
build YAC.  If you have built gcc and have the needed libs installed,
you will have to do nothing but type 'make' in your yac directory to
build yac.  You can then transfer it to your TiVo using FTP.

If you have the compiler or libs in an unsual place, you can edit these
locations in the Makefile.


CONTACT INFO AND BUG REPORTING

You can contact the author with questions, source modifications, etc.
You can also post a message on the TiVo Community Forum Underground,
as I read that message board and can reply to your question there.

MODIFYING SOURCE CODE

You are welcome to modify source code under the terms of the GNU
General Public License; however, you must supply me any modifications
you make.  Send me an e-mail with your code modifications; if they are
generally worthwhile, I'll include them in the official YAC distribution.
