Schema Specific Notes
---------------------
The CID.ISDNCID Schema is an extension of the CID.BASIC Schema, and is compatible with the CID.BASIC format.

The caller name is supplied if known to ISDNCID's database, otherwise it's blank. 

Call Types are only reported on the "Call End" Trigger Message

"Fax" call types report the number of fax pages received correctly, and the image file saved. 

"message recorded" call type returns the length of the recorded message, and the file path to the recorded wav file. 

All other types report the ringtime before any action was taken.

Standard Notes
--------------
HBEAT.* = hbeat.basic or hbeat.app etc
(hbeat items) = standard .basic or .app heartbeat items
[] = optional
<> = parameter value description
