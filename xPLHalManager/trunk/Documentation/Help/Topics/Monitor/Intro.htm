		<h2>Monitor</h2>
		<p align="justify">The monitor is a tool that allows you to view xPL messages on 
			your network.</p>
		<P align="justify">It provides a list of xPL messages, specifying their type, 
			source, target, schema, time and hop. Details of the contents are provided at 
			the bottom of the page when a message is highlighted in the list.</P>
		<P align="justify">The filter provides a method of limiting the number of messages 
			listed. If the filter is enabled, then only messages of source, schema or type 
			that are ticked will appear in the list. Any messages with a source, schema or 
			type that is not listed will not appear in the list. If the filter is not 
			enabled, all messages will be listed.<br>
			Note that if you tick only one item on one of the tabs and leave all other 
			items unticked, you will see NO xPL messages. You must have at least one item 
			ticked on each tab before you will see any xPL messages. The simplest way to 
			use the filter is to tick all the items then untick the items on a single tab 
			that you do not wish to see messages for.</P>
