<h2>A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Determinator</h2>
In this section we will guide you through the steps required to create a Determinator using the New Determinator Wizard.<br>
<br>
<h3>Before you begin</h3>
The Wizard makes extensive use of vendor-plugins. These are small files written by device vendors that the xPLHal Manager uses to gather information
about the capabilities of a particular device.<br>
Before beginning the New Determinator Wizard, it is recommended that you update your plug-in library with the latest versions
of all available plugins.<br>
You can do this by selecting Help -&gt; Update Plug-in Library from within the xPLHal Manager.<br>
When the list of plug-ins appears, click Select All, then click OK.<br>
After a few seconds, you should receive a message telling you how many plug-ins were downloaded successfully.<br>
Once this has completed, restart the xPLHal Manager for the new plug-ins to be loaded.<br>
<br>
<h3>Starting the Wizard</h3>
To start the New Determinator Wizard, right-click on the Determinators node in the xPLHal Manager tree and select New Determinator.<br>
<br>
When the welcome screen of the wizard appears, click Next.<br>
<br>
<h3>Naming your Determinator</h3>
The first step in the process of creating your Determinator is to assign it a name by which you can identify it.<br>
You can use any combination of alphanumeric characters, including spaces, when naming your Determinator.<br>
You may also optionally specify a description for your Determinator.<br>
<br>
When you have entered a name and optionally a description for your new Determinator, click Next.<br>
<br>
<h3>Adding Conditions to your Determinator</h3>
In order for a Determinator to be executed, there must be at least one initiating event.<br>
This can either be the arrival of a specific type of xPL message, or the value of a global variable changing.<br>
<br>
The Conditions page lets you define as many conditions as you wish, with the option of specifying whether all the conditions must be true for the Determinator to be executed,
or whether only one of the conditions needs to be true.<br>
<br>
Click the Add button to add your first condition.<br>
<br>
First, select the xPL device that will send a message to initiate the Determinator. 
If you wish to have this Determinator initiated based on the value of a global variable, you should
select your xPLHal server from the list of devices.<br>
<br>
Once you have selected a device, a list of the various types of information that the device can report will
be listed in the right-hand list box. Just click on the one you are interested in - for example,
in the case of the CM12, you can select "X10 signal received".<br>
<br>
Depending on which item you have selected, you may need to supply extra information.
For example, if you select "X10 signal received", you will need to specify the type of signal you are interested in
(on, off, dim, bright etc.) and the house or device code.<br>
<br>
You may also allocate a friendly name to the condition to help you identify it. This is especially useful for Determinators that
contain more than one condition.<br>
<br>
Click OK to add your new condition to the list.<br>
If you are new to Determinators, we recommend you specify only a single condition initially, as you
can build up more complex Determinators once your basic Determinator is functioning.<br>
<br>
Click the Next button to continue to the next screen.<br>
<br>

<h3>Specifying Actions</h3>
The Actions page lets you specify a list of actions that the Determinator will perform if the conditions you specified on the previous page are met.<br>
Any number of actions can be specified, and the order in which they are executed can be controlled 
by changing the position of an action in the list using the Up and Down buttons.<br>
<br>
Click the Add button to add an action.<br>
<br>
Select the xPL device you wish to target, then select the action you wish to perform.<br>
You may need to enter additional information, depending on your chosen action.<br>
<br>
You can also select whether the action is targetted at the specific device you selected, at
all devices that can understand the action, or at a particular group of devices.<br>
<br>
Click OK to save your action.<br>
Use the Add button to add any additional actions to your Determinator.<br>
Click the Next button to continue, and on the finish screen, click Finish to save
the Determinator.<br>
<br>
<h3>Testing your Determinator</h3>
Determinators become active as soon as they are created, and any changes you make to a Determinator take effect as soon as you click the OK button.<br>
You can now go ahead and test your Determinator.<br>
<br>
You can edit your Determinator by selecting it from the list of Determinators in the xPLHal Manager.<br>
