<h2>X10 Language Extensions</h2>
The x10 class provides extensions to VBScript to allow direct integration with X10 devices and the xPLHal X10 device cache.
<br>
<h4>To send an X10 command</h4>
<pre>x10.Send(&lt;device&gt;, &lt;function&gt;, &lt;brightness&gt;)
&lt;device&gt; is a string containing the X10 device to be controlled, e.g. A1, F2, H3 etc.
&lt;function&gt; is a string containing the function to be executed.
Supported functions are:
ON
OFF
DIM
BRIGHT
ALL LIGHTS OFF
ALL LIGHTS ON
ALL UNITS OFF
&lt;brightness&gt; is an integer that specifies the level of the dim or bright command.
For commands other than dim and bright, this parameter is ignored and should be set to zero.
</pre>

<h4>Load X10 Device and Attributes</h4>
<pre>x10.loaddevice(<device>,<device type>,<is a light>, <resume dim>, <dim type>, <tracks dim level>, <label>, <timeout>, <State>, <Location>,<OnImage>,<OffImage>,<Overwrite>)
e.g. call x10.loaddevice("A1",X10_LIGHT,True,True,X10_X10,True,"Kitchen Light",10,X10_OFF,location_kitchen,"light_on.gif","light_off.gif",False)
The &lt;location&gt; parameter is for future use, most likely in the web interface
The &lt;OnImage&gt; and &lt;OffImage&gt; parameters are for the web interface
The &lt;Overwrite&gt; parameter is to determine if record for this device should be overwritten, however once the x10 devices are
loaded into the database the loaddevice commands could be remarked out

NOTE: some items are for future use

You should not need to use this command under normal circumstances, as you can add X10 devices via the X10 node in the xPLHal Manager.
</pre>

<h4>To set an individual x10 attribute</h4>
<pre>x10.attrib(<device>,<attribute>)=<new value>
e.g. x10.attrib("A1",X10_TIMEOUT)=5
This function is available, but should not be used except in exceptional/unusual circumstances
</pre>

<h4>To get an individual x10 attribute</h4>
<pre>x10.attrib(<device>,<attribute>)
e.g. lightstate=x10.attrib("A1",X10_STATE)

The file ./scripts/headers/xplhal_x10.xpl contains all of the supported constants
Please refer to this file for available values
</pre>
<br>
The state of the X10 device cache is maintained automatically by xPLHal.
It tracks device state changes, including commands that effect multiple devices.
However, the nature of x10 means the maintaining of these states is based purely on
the interpretation of xpl messages. Testing to improve this functionality will be
on-going. 
<br><br>
The x10 cache is ONLY updated in response to xpl-trig messages
(All x10 xpl app's should return an xpl-trig message, in response to an xpl-cmnd message,
to confirm the message was received and actioned)
<br>
The DIM/BRIGHT function support is minimal at the moment, but will be improved.
<br>
<h4>To delete an X10 device</h4>
<pre>x10.DeleteDevice(&lt;deviceName&gt;)</pre>
This command deletes the specified X10 device from the database.
