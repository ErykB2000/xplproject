		<h2>Overview of Timed Events in xPLHal</h2>
		In addition to executing scripts in response to xPL messages being received, 
		xPLHal includes a Timed Events Engine that allows scripts to be executed based 
		on specific dates or times.
		<br>
		xPLHal supports three different types of timed events - Single, Recurring and 
		Repeating.<br>
		<h2><a name="single">Single Events</a></h2>
		Single events are those which occur only once, on a specified date, and at a 
		specified time. As soon as the event has been executed, it will be removed from 
		the events database.<br>
		Although you specify an absolute date and time when a single event should 
		occur, you can optionally specify a level of randomisation. This will cause the 
		event to occur a random number of minutes after the specified time, and can add 
		a more realistic feel to your home automation system.
		<br>
		You can view all currently defined single events by clicking on the "Single 
		Events" node, which can be found under the "Events" section in the xPLHal 
		Manager.
		<br>
		<h2><a name="recurring">Recurring Events</a></h2>
		Recurring events are those which are configured to occur on a 
		regular basis. For example, a recurring event could be executed every weekday, 
		or every Saturday, or every day. As with single events, the actual time that 
		the event occurs can be randomised to add a more realistic feel to your home 
		automation system.
		<br>
		You can view all currently defined recurring events by selecting the "Recurring 
		Events" node from below the "Events" node in the xPLHal Manager.
		<br>
		<h2><a name="repeating">Repeating Events</a></h2>
		Repeating events are those which are configured to occur repeatedly on a 
		regular basis. For example, a repeating event could be executed every weekday, 
		or every Saturday, or every day, and repeat at twenty minute intervals between 
		four and six p.m. As with other events, the actual time that the event occurs 
		can be randomised to add a more realistic feel to your home automation system.
		<br>
		You can view all currently defined repeating events by selecting the "Recurring 
		Events" node from below the "Events" node in the xPLHal Manager.
		<br>
		When viewing events in the xPLHal Manager, an icon indicates whether sunroutine 
		or a determinator will be run.
