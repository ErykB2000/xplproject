<h2>Creating a Single Event</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the xPLHal Manager, on the File menu, select New -> Event.<br>
The New Event Wizard will then appear.
<li>On the Welcome screen, click Next.
<li>You will then be asked whether you wish to create a single or recurring event.<br>
Select Single Event and click Next.
<li>You are then asked to specify which sub-routine will be executed when this event runs.<br>
You can either pick the sub-routine from the list of all currently defined routines, or you can use the Sub Routine Builder to create simple sub-routines without having to write any code.
<li>Once you have created or selected your sub-routine, enter any parameters you would like passed to the routine, then click Next.
<li>You must now specify the date and time at which the event will occur. The Events Engine will execute scripts within 30 seconds of the specified time.<br>
When you have selected the desired date and time, click Next.
<li>You are now invited to specify how much randomisation should occur with this event.<br>
The figure you enter in the randomisation box will be the maximum number of minutes that xPLHal will delay execution of your event.<br>
For example, if you configure an event to occur at 18:00, and set a randomisation period of 30, the event will occur some time between 18:00 and 18:30.<br>
If you do not wish to have the time of the event randomised at all, simply leave the default value of zero in place.<br>
Click Next once you have entered your desired randomisation period.
<li>Finally, you must provide a name to identify this event.<br>
This name can contain spaces, and will be displayed in the list of upcoming single events.<br>
Enter a suitable name and click Next.
<li>The Wizard is now complete, and you will be presented with the details of the event you have just configured.<br>
Click Finish to create the event.
</ul>
