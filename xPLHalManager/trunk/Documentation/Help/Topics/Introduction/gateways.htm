<h2>xPL Gateways</h2>
xPLHal does not interact directly with any hardware devices - it merely sends and receives xPL messages.<br>
In order to make use of a particular hardware device in your xPL-based home automation environment, you must obtain an xPL Gateway application for the device.<br>
This is usually a piece of software that runs on a PC and provides a logical connection between the hardware device and the xPL network.
<br>
The following is a brief list of some of the typical home automation devices which have xPL Gateway applications available free of charge:<br>
<ul>
<li>CTI Meteor Caller ID Unit
<li>RealPlayer
<li>RedRat2 Infra-red transmitter
<li>RedRat3 Infra-red transmitter/receiver
<li>Rio Digital Audio Receiver
<li>SliMP3 Ethernet MP3 Player
<li>Text-to-speech system for voice announcements
<li>Tivo Personal Video Recorder
<li>Winamp
<li>X10 CM11/Cm12 Computer Interface
</ul>
