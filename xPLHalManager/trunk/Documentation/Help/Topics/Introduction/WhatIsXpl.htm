<h2>What is xPL?</h2>


xPL is an open protocol intended to permit the control and monitoring of home automation devices. The primary design goal of xPL is to provide a rich set of features and functionality, whilst maintaining an elegant, uncomplicated message structure. The protocol includes complete discovery and auto-configuration capabilities which support a fully "plug-n-play" architecture - essential to ensure a good end-user experience.<br>
xPL benefits from a strongly-specified message structure, required to ensure that xPL-enabled devices from different vendors are able to communicate without the risk of incompatibilities.<br>
<br>
The protocol consists of three basic message types:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>xpl-cmnd</b> (Command)<br>
This message type carries instructions to be performed. For example, open lounge curtain.<br>
<li><b>xpl-trig</b> (Trigger)<br>
This message is generated when a device/application has a change of state.<br>
It may also be generated in response to an xPL command (confirming action)<br>
For example, lounge curtain is open.<br>
<li><b>xpl-stat</b> (Status)<br>
This message type is used for four main purposes,<br>
1. Request remote configuration at startup<br>
2. Provide an "i'm alive" heartbeat<br>
3. Provide regular status information, if applicable<br>
4. Generate a response that cannot be considered a 'change of state' (e.g. the results of a database lookup)<br>
</ul>
<br>
