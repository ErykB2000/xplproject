<h2>Backing Up your Data</h2>
To ensure that none of your valuable xPLHal configuration data, which includes your globals collection, recurring events database, and script library, is lost or damaged in the event of either hardware or software failure, we recommend that you take suitable steps to back it up on a regular basis.
<br>
All the data you need to backup can be found in the Data folder, located in the directory where you installed the xPLHal service.
By default this is C:\Program Files\xPL\xPLHal\Data.
<br><br>
The following is a list of the folders and files in your data directory, with a brief explanation of their purpose.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Configs<br>
This folder contains a copy of all device configurations that have been issued by xPLHal to the various xPL devices on your network.
<li>Scripts Folder<br>
This folder contains all your scripts.
<li>Vendor<br>
This folder contains the vendor information for all xPL devices that xPLHal has detected on your network, as well as any vendor-supplied configuration files you may have added manually.
<li>xplhal.xml<br>
This is the main xPLHal configuration file.
<li>xplhal_events.bin<br>
This is the events database.
<li>xplhal_globals.bin<br>
This is the collection of global variables.
<li>xplhal_x10cache.bin<br>
This is the X10 cache. It contains information about the status of every X10 device in your system, as well as any user-defined information you may have added through the X10 Device Editor.
</ul>
