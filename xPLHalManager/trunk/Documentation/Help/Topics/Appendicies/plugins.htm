<h2>xPLHal Manager Plug-In Development</h2>
xPLHal Manager's user interface can be easily extended to support specific devices through the use of plug-ins. A plug-in is simply an XML document that
contains information about one or more devices. xPLHal Manager uses this information to enhance it's user interface.<br>
<br>

<h3>Customised Context Menus</h3>
You can write code in your plug-ins that allows custom context menu items to appear when a user right-clicks on your xPL device.<br>
For example, for a mixer device, you may want to provide features like Mute, Set Balance, Set Volume etc.

<h3>Sub-Builder Wizard Functions</h3>
You can add extra functions to the sub-routine builder so that users can control your devices without needing to write the initial VBScript required to do so.

<h3>Device Configuration Information</h3>
You can add extra information about your xPL devices so that the user receives helpful information during the configuration of your devices.

<h3>Plug-In Management and Automatic Updates</h3>
Plug-ins are stored in the Plugins directory within the main xPLHal Manager installation directory.<br>
The xPLHal Manager includes a Plug-In Administration Page, which will list all plug-ins available for download from the xPLHal Manager web site, and can then automatically download or update selected plug-ins, as chosen by the end-user.<br>
If you would like your own plug-in to be added to the list of available plug-ins, please contact the xPLHal Development Team.

<h3>Writing a Plug-In</h3>
The easiest way to start writing a plug-in is to look at the plugins that are currently available, and modify them to meet your own needs.<br>
You can do this by selecting Help -> Update Plug-in Library.<br>
When the list of plug-ins appears, click "Select All", then click "OK". All available plug-ins will then be downloaded and available for you to examine.<br>
