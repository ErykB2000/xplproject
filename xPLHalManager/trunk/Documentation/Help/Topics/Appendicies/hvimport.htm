<h1>Importing X10 Devices from HomeVision</h1>

This feature allows you to import your X10 device names from HomeVision, saving you the job of entering all your X10 device information into xPLHal by hand.
It will only import devices that have been renamed, e.g. not named "X10 A1" and so on.
<br><br>
To import your devices, follow the steps below:<br>
<br>
In the HomeVision PC client:
<ul>
 <li>Make sure the latest schedule is loaded into the application.
 <li>Goto File-Export Schedule.<br>
  This will save a file with yourschedulename.hvx to the HomeVision program
  directory (normally c:\Program Files\HomeVision\ but sometimes it can save
  the file to c:\)
</ul>

In xPLHal Manager:
<ul>
 <li>Select Tools -&gt; Import HomeVision X10 Devices.
 <li>When the Open File dialog box appears, select the HomeVision schedule file that you saved previously.
 <li>You will receive a message telling you how many devices were imported.
 <li>Select (or refresh) the X10 device list in xPLHal Manager to see your newly imported devices.
</ul>
