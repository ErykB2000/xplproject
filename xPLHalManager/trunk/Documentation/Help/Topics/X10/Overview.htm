<h2>Overview of X10 Technology</h2>
<br>
<h3>What is X10, and what can you do with it?</h3>
X10 is a system for controlling mains appliances and lighting using signals carried over mains power cables. X10 modules
are available that replace ordinary lightswitches, mains outlets, and pendant lamp holders. As well as being controlled
locally as normal, appliances can also be controlled remotely using keypads, radio and infra-red remote controls, timers,
and computer interfaces. X10 can be used for many applications; here are a few examples. 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Extending a light with a single lightswitch to be controllable from two, three or even more locations with no
                             additional wiring. 
<li>Switching lights on and off at set or random times, or opening and closing blinds and curtains to give an illusion of
                             occupancy when the house is empty. 
<li>Controlling groups of lights or appliances from a single switch point. 
<li>Allowing lights and appliances to be controlled from outside the house. Using Internet or telephone control allows
                             control from any distance from the house. 
</ul>

Through use of a computer interface such as the CM11 or CM12, you can have complete 2-way communication between your xPL Home Automation System and your X10 devices.
The xPLHal product includes native support for X10 devices, making it very easy to integrate into your X10 solution.
Please see the remaining chapters in this topic for further details on the X10 support provided by xPLHal.

<h3>X10 principles</h3>
X10 works by carrying control signals over the domestic mains power wiring. Because most houses are wired so that all
power and lighting circuits originate from the same point, a control device in one part of the house can control appliances in
another part. This means that controllers do not have to be wired directly to appliances. 
Control signals can be generated by various sources, including plug-in controllers, radio and infra-red receivers, and
computer interfaces. These signals are detected by appliance and lamp controllers, among other things. The X10 protocol
also provides for a controller to determine the status (on or off) of an appliance, although many appliance modules don't
support this (see below). 
As all controllers and appliances are connected to the same mains wiring system, how does the X10 system determine
which device a particular control signal should be directed to? Embedded in each X10 signal are a `house code' and a `unit
code'. Both of these can take values between 1 and 16. Each appliance or lamp is set to respond to a single house
code/unit code combination. The house code was originally intended to allow adjacent houses to use X10 without
interfering with each other; this is necessary in theory because houses in the same neighbourhood may share a connection to
the power distribution system, so that control signals can `bleed' from one to another. In the UK, where uptake of X10 has
not been widespread, the house code and unit code can both be used to select which device to control. This means that a
total of 256 devices can be controlled independently in a given property.
