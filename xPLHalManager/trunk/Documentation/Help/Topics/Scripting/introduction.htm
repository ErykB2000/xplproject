<h2>Introduction to Scripting in xPLHal</h2>
The core of xPLHal is it's ability to execute VBScript routines in response to received xPL messages or timed events.<br>

It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the VBScript language, as well as the section on <a href="topics/concepts/default.htm">xPLHal
 Concepts</a>.
<br>
This section is intended to provide you with an overview of the xPLHal scripting system - it is not a guide to the VBScript programming language. Please refer to the MSDN for full documentation on the VBScript language.
<br>

<a name="reloading"><h3>Modifying and Reloading Scripts</h3></a>
It is important to realise that any changes made to scripts will not take effect until either the xPLHal service is restarted, or the Reload Scripts option is selected from the Scripts context menu in the xPLHal Manager.<br>
This allows you to modify a number of scripts, and have the changes take effect only when you have finished modifying all your scripts.
<br>

<h3>Language Extensions</h3>
In addition to the standard functions of the VBScript language, scripts that are executed by the xPLHal Scripting Engine have access to a number of extra classes, designed
to assist you in getting the most out of your xPLHal Home Automation System.
<br>
The following topics describe the various language extension classes in more detail.<br>
