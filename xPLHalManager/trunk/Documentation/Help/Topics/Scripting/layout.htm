<h2>Script Hierarchy</h2>
You can manage all of the scripts that are loaded by xPLHal by clicking on the Scripts node in the xPLHal Manager.<br>
Scripts are generally located in one of three locations:<br>
<ul>
<li>The root of the scripting hierarchy contains the majority of scripts. When xPLHal receives an incoming message, it will check to see if a script exists that matches the source of the incoming script. If no script exists, an empty one will be created.<br>
There are three scripts in the root folder which are worthy of mention:<br>
<b>XPLHAL_LOAD.XPL</b> contains a routine which is executed whenever the xPLHal service is started. This script contains some default code which we recommend you leave in place unless you are fully aware of the consequences of removing or modifying it.<br>
<b>XPLHAL_UNLOAD.XPL</b> contains a routine that is executed whenever the xPLHal service is shutting down. This also contains some default code which is required
to ensure that the various internal state information, such as the globals list and events database is saved to disk.<br>
<b>XPLHAL_SHARED.XPL</b> contains shared functions which you are likely to use in several of your scripts.<br>
<li>The Headers sub-folder contains scripts that are generated by xPLHal at startup. These include details about the various constructs that are used in script processing. You should not edit any scripts in the headers folder that begin with XPL, as these are system-generated, so any changes you make will be overwritten when xPLHal is next restarted. Other scripts in this folder, such as modes.xpl and periods.xpl are safe to be edited.<br>
<li>The User sub-folder is intended purely for your own user-defined scripts.
</ul>
