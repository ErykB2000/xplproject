warn the user and handle the situation gracefully.

Version 1.51
Release Date: 21 November 2005

New Features:
- Right-click on any xPL Device and select All Tasks -> More Info.
This will take you to the web site for the vendor of that device, provided that the info_url attribute has been
specified in the vendor's XML file.

=============================

Version 1.5
Release Date: 01 October 2005

New Features:
- Right-click on xPL Devices node and you can select Poll for Devices. 
This issues a hbeat.request so all devices can respond. The Manager will wait for 5 seconds to allow all devices to reply, 
then refresh the device list for you.

Fixes:
- Send xPL Message dialog no longer prepends a space to the source address.
- When adding the action to "Execute another Determinator" to an existing determinator,
  the dropdown list of determinators is now populated.
- When editing an event, the combo box for selecting the sub routine or determinator
  has been increased in size.
- Better support for accessibility software such as screen readers.

=============================

Version 1.45
Release Date: 3rd January 2005

New Features:
- You can right-click on any message in the xPL Monitor and automatically enter the New Determinator Wizard, with the Determinator
  already configured to run when the chosen message is received.
- You can right-click on any message in the xPL Monitor, and have a global variable automatically populated with a specific
  element from the chosen message. A determinator will be automatically created to populate the global whenever the message is received.
  

Modifications:
- Plug-ins are now stored under the system's common application data folder.
  By default, this is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\xPL\Plugins.
  This is to allow other applications other than the xPLHal Manager to reliably locate plug-in files.
  When you run the Manager for the first time, it will move all your plug-ins to the new location.
- The Sub Routine Builder is no longer supported, and has been removed.
- Globals list refresh is now optional via the tools menu.

Fixes:
- The xPL Monitor now functions correctly when running with no hub.

=============================

Release Date: Friday, 17th December 2004

New Features:
- The new "xPL Network Settings" utility (xplsettings.exe) is now included as part of the main distribution, and is available via an item on the Tools menu.
This utility lets you specify things like the broadcast address, the IP addresses to which xPL applications should bind,
and the IP addresses that xPL applications should listen to traffic from.
These settings will apply to any application built using the upcoming version 3.0 release of the xPL .NET library.

- You can now select which portion of the xPLHal Manager tree will be selected at startup. Just right-click on the node that
you want to appear at startup and select "Set as default".
- Globals list now refreshes automatically every 30 seconds.

Fixes:
- xPL devices now sorted properly (previously only vendor portion of source was sorted)
